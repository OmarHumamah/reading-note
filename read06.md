# Design web pages with CSS.
### What is CSS.
* (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages
* CSS can be used for very basic document text styling, for example changing the color and size of headings and links

### How to add CSS.
* **External CSS**

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
* **InternalCSS**

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside.
* **Inline CSS**

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

* **Multiple Style Sheets**


If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
