In another word, it is a process of sketching the interface of (a webpage, an app or any project) in order to be obvious to a user in real world.

**How to make a wireframe?**

 First, you should start by draw a quick sketch for the shape of the interface on a paper. Then, try to think about the main things that should appear on the main screen, as button, images, logo and ect.. 
After that, make a quick revesion to the sketch to know if everything is in the right place.

Second thing to do is picking an online wireframe tool, like Wireframe.cc, to digitize your sketch as a prototype. Now you can transfer what in your sketch paper into the wireframe tool and adjest the shape, buttons, logo and ect.
So, we use pen and paper, and digitil wireframe tool.
