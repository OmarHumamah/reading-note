 First, you should start by draw a quick sketch for the shape of the interface on a paper. Then, try to think about the main things that should appear on the main screen, as button, images, logo and ect..

**HTML basics**

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content.

## Semantics
**Semantics**

In *programming*, **Semantics** refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)


* **Semantics in CSS**

In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

* **Semantics in HTML**

In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
