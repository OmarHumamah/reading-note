# Forms  & Events
## forms
**Why we use forms?**
We use forms to collect data from the user, then we can use this data to make the web page interact with the user.
* `<label>` element is to but name the form input element 
* `<input>` element is to to make a field that the user can fill with his/her information.

**There is many types of inputs**

1. `text` to one line text "the value is always string"
2. `<textarea>` it is an element to create space to user type a paragraph.
