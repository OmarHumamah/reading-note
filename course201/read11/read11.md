# CSS images & audio and video
## CSS images
* you can modify images in CSS with many properties, and you can add background images with different styles.

	* `width` % `hight` to control the size of the image.
	* you can use `float` with images to inline it with a text or move it left or right.
	* with `margin : 0px auto` you can center an image in the middle of the page.
 * **you can add background to the page by selecting the body element or you can add it to specific element by `background-image: url();`**
	* `background-repeat: repeat` to repeat the image in both horizontally and vertically / `repeat-x` horizontally / `repeat-y`vertically.
	* `background-attachment: fixed` the image will stay at the same position while scrolling / `scroll` will move up and down as the user scrolls.
	* `background-position`:
	
	 ![psitn](pstin.jpg)
