# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

- What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

  - the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

  - The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

  2. the role of female in tech industry is increasing remarkably.
  3. the asian considered as they pioneer in tech industry.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

- When are diversity efforts most successful?

  - Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

- Why do diverse companies perform better?

  - Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
