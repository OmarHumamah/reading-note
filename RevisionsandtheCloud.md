**Remote Repositories**
- We use `Remote Repositories` to collaborate Git projects so uou can work with multiple repositories online. Also, teams can use *remote repositories* to `push` information to and `pull` data from.

**Seeing Your Remotes**
- there are two ways to see your remotes.
  * By running the *git remote* command, you can view the short names, such as `origin,` of all specified remote handles.
  * By using *git remote -v*, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

 > $ cd example

 >$ git remote -v

 >remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)

 >remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)

 >remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)

 >remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)

 >remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch)

 >remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)

**Dictionary**  
1. `Remote Repositories`: Interaction with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network to collaborate on Git projects, by pushing and pulling information.
2. `pull`: Fetching entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project.
3. `push`: To push your changes “upstream” for sharing.
