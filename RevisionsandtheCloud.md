Remote Repositories
We use *Remote Repositories* to collaborate Git projects so uou can work with multiple repositories online. Also, teams can use *remote repositories* to `push` information to and `pull` data from.

Seeing Your Remotes
there is two ways to see your remotes.
By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
