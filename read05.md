# Expressions and operators
javascript has many expressions and operators, and each one has specific function. We will take the most prominent of them.

**Assignment operators**

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

**Comparison operators**

Comparison operators compares between two values and gives a logical result (true, false).

>>Equal (==), Not equal (!=), Strict equal (===), Strict not equal (!==), Greater than (>), Greater than or equal (>=), Less than (<), Less than or equal (<=).

**Logical operators**

Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value. The logical operators are described in the following table.


* Logical AND (&&)	`expr1 && expr2`	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
* Logical OR **(||)**	`expr1 || expr2`	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, **||** returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
* Logical NOT (!)	`!expr`	Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.
