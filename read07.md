# Control flow & Function
**Control flow** is the order that the computer will read and execute statements or processes in a script.

computer reads code from the first line to the last line unless it runs across a structure that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

*function*, also, is one of of the structures that could change the control flow. *function* could have a loop, and you can order it by calling or invoking it so that the computer will return to the line in wich have the function componants and execute it againe every time it invoked.

`Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.`

**function**

* A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

* A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
* You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

* You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

* The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

 - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
 - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
 - Automatically (self invoked)
