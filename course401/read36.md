# Application State with Redux

## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

- Local Storage is vulnerable to XSS attacks, and cookies are automatically attached to every HTTP request on your server. and in cookies you can set a season for the token or expire date.

## Explain 3rd party cookies.

- First-party cookies live on the website you are currently visiting. Third-party cookies are created by websites other than the one you are currently visiting.

## How do pixel tags work?

- As a pixel loads, it runs associated javascript code which does a given action. In the context of advertising, these often collect and send data back to some third party.

- `cookies`: They are built specifically for Internet web browsers to track, personalize, and save information about each user's session. A “session” just refers to the time you spend on a site. Cookies are created to identify you when you visit a new website.
- `authorization`: Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function.
- `access control`: It is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.
- `conditional rendering`: the process of using React to render certain components or elements based on conditional logic.
