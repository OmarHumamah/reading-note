## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

- Redux Toolkit is a full opinionated library for managing and organizing redux development. Ducks is simply an organizational paradigm for how to lay out the file structure of a redux project for efficient scaling and maintenance.

## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

- It speeds up the development process by providing boilerplate code, and enforces best practices with redux organization.

---

- `redux toolkit slices`: It is a function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.
- `namespace`: It is a set of signs that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
