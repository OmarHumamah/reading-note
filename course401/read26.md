# Component Based UI 

## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

- Angular.js
- Embre.js
- Meteor.js
- Backbone.js
- Vue.js

## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

- Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
- A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
- The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.

- `Rendering`: It is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. The term generally refers to the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The process is completed by a rendering engine, the software used by a web browser to render a web page.
- `Templates`: It  is a generic class or other unit of source code that can be used as the basis for unique units of code.
- `State`: It is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component.

## Introducing JSX

- It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

- JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

### Why JSX?
- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

- Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

- React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
