## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

1. fill your time with what is worth.
2. **“Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness**; to be focused on your gaol is more important than being busy.
3. **Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy**; focus, manage time, _If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you_.
4. **As You Think, So You Are**; let the people know that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, and learn to say no to unimportant things.

### In conclusion

- In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules.
- Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.
- How do you value your time?
- Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?
- How many activities were a true waste of time?
- Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## How to think like a programmer

### Steps to thing like a programmer

1. Understand
   - You should understand the problem to solve it! Analyze it and try to think about it manually.
2. Plan
   - Do not start coding directly. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information, and write some comments and hints.
3. Divide
   - Do not try to solve a big problem at one, divide the problem to sub-problems, solve them one by one then connect the dots together.
4. Stuck?
   - if you stuck try these three methods:-
     - **Debug**: Go step by step through your solution.
     - **Reassess**: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
     - **Research**: use Google, StackOverflow, ...etc.
