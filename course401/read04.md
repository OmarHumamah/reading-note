# Data Modeling

- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
    1. It allows you to test the code inputs and outputs and if the code is working correctly
    2. It allows you to catch the errors and know how deal with it
    3. IT gives the code better programing design and higher code quality.

- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
    - in case you need o test the codes beforeEach test start the server and afterEach test close or drop the server.
- What is one downside of Test Driven Development.
    - If you start TDD, you will get the feeling that you need a longer duration of time for easy implementations. You need to think about the interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you can finally start writing the code.
- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    - Classes make Child and parent objects. 
- Why REST?
    1. One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility.
     
    2. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.
